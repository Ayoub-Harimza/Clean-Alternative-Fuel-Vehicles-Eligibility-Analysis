# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section, the following actions were performed using Python with pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib:

1. Loaded the dataset (`Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv`) into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Displayed the first few rows of the dataset using `df.head()` to get an initial glimpse.
3. Checked the basic information about the dataset using `df.info()`.
4. Explored the number of unique values in each column using `df.nunique()`.
5. Dropped columns deemed unimportant for the analysis.
6. Checked the shape of the DataFrame using `df.shape` to understand its dimensions.
7. Investigated and handled missing values using `df.isna().sum()` and subsequently removed rows with missing values from the DataFrame.

This EDA serves as the preliminary steps to understand the structure, content, and quality of the dataset before diving into further analysis and visualization.

# Data Visualization with Tableau
The data was visualized using Tableau. The interactive version of the dashboard can be found on [Tableau's website](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book2_17052462280990/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
